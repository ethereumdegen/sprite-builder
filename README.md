# 🛠️ Sprite Builder

Sign in with GitHub, pick a repo, click **New build** (or hit the API) — a
background worker spins up a [sprites.dev](https://sprites.dev) sandbox, builds
your repo's Docker image at a given commit, runs it, and gives you back a live
URL. Everything is recorded in Postgres (NeonDB).

```

The **API server** and the **build worker** are separate binaries/processes that
share the same `lib` and database — so you can scale or deploy them
independently (mirrors the `../devops-agent` layout).

## How auth works

- **Web UI** authenticates via **GitHub OAuth**; the backend stores a session
  and sets an `sb_session` cookie. The user's GitHub token is stored server-side
  and used to list repos, resolve commits, and clone during a build.
- **The API** is gated by **bearer API keys**. Create one in the *API Keys* page;
  the secret (`sb_…`) is shown once and only its SHA-256 hash is stored.

Every `/api/*` route accepts **either** a session cookie **or**
`Authorization: Bearer <api-key>`, so the same endpoints power the UI and
programmatic access.

## Setup

### 1. NeonDB

Create a project at [neon.tech](https://neon.tech) and grab the connection
string (it looks like `postgres://…neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require`).

### 2. GitHub OAuth App

Create one at <https://github.com/settings/developers>:

- **Homepage URL:** `http://localhost:5173`
- **Authorization callback URL:** `http://localhost:5173/api/auth/github/callback`

> In dev the Vite server proxies `/api` to the backend, so the browser only ever
> talks to `:5173` — that keeps the session cookie same-origin. Set `BACKEND_URL`
> to the origin the **browser** hits (`:5173` in dev), not the backend's `:8787`.

Scopes requested: `read:user repo`.

### 3. sprites.dev token

Create a token at <https://sprites.dev/account> (or `sprite org auth`). Note your
org slug — the public build URL is `https://<sprite-name>-<org>.sprites.dev`.

### 4. Env

```bash
cp backend/.env.example .env     # dev.sh reads ./.env at the repo root
$EDITOR .env                      # fill in DATABASE_URL, GITHUB_*, SPRITES_*
```

### 5. Run it

```bash
./dev.sh                 # starts API server + build worker + Vite frontend
# ./dev.sh --no-worker   # skip the worker
```

Open <http://localhost:5173>. (First Rust build takes a few minutes.)

Run migrations explicitly if you want: `cd backend && cargo run --bin migrate`.
The server also auto-applies them on startup.

## Using the API

```bash
KEY=sb_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
BASE=http://localhost:5173      # or your deployed origin

# list projects
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" $BASE/api/projects

# create a project for a repo
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"my-app","repo_full_name":"me/my-app","default_branch":"main","container_port":8080}' \
  $BASE/api/projects

# trigger a build (omit commit_sha to build HEAD of the default branch)
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{}' $BASE/api/projects/<project-id>/builds

# poll a build
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" $BASE/api/builds/<build-id>
```

## How a build runs (the worker)

For each `queued` build the worker:

1. claims the row atomically (`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`),
2. creates a sprite (`POST /v1/sprites`),
3. uploads a build script and launches it **detached**, then polls its log file
   and streams output into `builds.logs` (so the UI shows **live logs**). The
   script: `git clone` the repo at the target commit → `docker build` the
   `Dockerfile` → `docker run -d -p 8080:<container_port>`,
4. treats the build as successful only when the script's exit code is `0` **and**
   a success marker is present — not merely because the HTTP call returned 200,
5. makes the sprite URL public and **probes it until it serves** (a non-5xx
   response) before marking `succeeded`; if it never responds, the build is
   `failed` with `metadata.ready=false`,
6. on success, tears down the project's **older** sprites (blue-green: one live
   deployment per project); on failure, deletes the just-created sprite.

Two more safety nets: a **reaper** fails builds stuck in `running` for too long
(crashed worker), and the GitHub token is passed via a **git credential helper**
(never in the clone URL) and **redacted** from stored logs.

**sprites.dev proxies external traffic to port `8080` inside the VM**, so the
worker maps the container's port to host `8080`. Set a project's `container_port`
to whatever your app listens on (default `8080`).

## Build target repos

A target repo just needs a **`Dockerfile`** at `dockerfile_path` (default
`Dockerfile`) that produces a container listening on `container_port`. A typical
Rust + React app uses a multi-stage Dockerfile (build the SPA, build the Rust
binary, serve both) — exactly like this repo's own `Dockerfile`.

## Deploying (Railway)

Two services off the same repo:

- **API server** — root `railway.toml` / root `Dockerfile`. Serves the API and
  the built SPA from `/app/static`. Healthcheck `/api/health`.
- **Build worker** — `worker/railway.toml` / `worker/Dockerfile`
  (set the service root directory to the repo root).

Both need the same env vars (`DATABASE_URL`, `GITHUB_*`, `SPRITES_*`,
`SPRITES_ORG`). In production set `BACKEND_URL` and `FRONTEND_URL` to your real
`https://` origin and update the GitHub OAuth callback URL to match.

## Notes & assumptions

- The sprites REST shapes are coded against the public docs
  (`https://docs.sprites.dev/api/`): `POST /v1/sprites`, `POST
  /v1/sprites/{name}/exec`, public URL `https://<sprite>-<org>.sprites.dev`. If
  the API rev changes (`set_url_public`, exec response framing), adjust
  `backend/src/sprites.rs` — it's isolated there.
- Docker-in-sprite: the build script installs Docker if it's missing and starts
  `dockerd`. Depending on your sprite base image and network egress policy you
  may want to pre-bake Docker into a sprite checkpoint instead.
- The GitHub token is used via a git credential helper (never placed in the clone
  URL) and is redacted from stored logs. It is, however, still stored **plaintext
  at rest** in `users.github_token` — encrypt it (and prefer a GitHub App /
  short-lived tokens) before multi-tenant use.
- Migrations run automatically on startup of both the server and the worker;
  sqlx takes a Postgres advisory lock so concurrent startup is safe. You can also
  run them explicitly as a deploy step: `cargo run --bin migrate`.
